# Objectives

Machine Learning techniques are revolutionizing the world. This revolution is not only happening in industry but also in the research community.
Therefore, this team studies the use of machine-learning techniques to solve problems in the Distributed Computing and cyber security fields. 

Currently, we are studying machine-learning techniques on:

- Generation of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms
